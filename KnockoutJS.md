KnockoutJS vs AngularJS


Similirity:

  Angular and Knockout both provide DOM based templating.


Templating:

  Knockout by default uses HTML as its templating mechanism ( which is where
  they both have DOM based templating ) , but Knockout also supports other
  string based templating engines like Handlebars etc (but I think hardly
  anyone uses that!).

  Angular only supports HTML as its templating mechanism.

Rails:
  It's not hard to use KnockoutJS in rails, following are Rails usage:

    Add the following to your gemfile:

      gem 'knockoutjs-rails'

    Add the following directive to your Javascript manifest file (application.js):

      //= require knockout

    You can optionally add the object mapping plugin for Knockout (also application.js):

      //= require knockout.mapping
